## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project gave me the first experience of working with variable fonts and using pseudo-class ```:hover``` for more advanced styling.

### Continued development

I look forward to learn more about pseudo-classes to improve my CSS skills and make modern, comfortable for use webpages.
